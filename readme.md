# Idea-to-Pitch Generator

This project is a creative, multi-step AI workflow built with [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).  
It takes your rough project idea and automatically generates:

1. A refined project description  
2. A one-sentence summary  
3. A catchy project name  
4. An elevator pitch

Perfect for hackathons, demos, or brainstorming sessions!
